              We're ruthless about godness. We have no qualms about tearing up a
              day-old lettuce leaf (straight from the farm), or steaming a baby
              (carrot). Cut. Cut. Chop. Chop. Steam. Steam. Stir Stir. While
              they're still young and fresh - that's our motto. It makes the
              kitchen a better place.{" "}

              They make sauces sing and salads dance. They create magic with
              skill, knowledge, passion and stirring spoons (among other
              things). They make goodness so good, it doesn't know what to do
              with itself. We do though. We send it to you.
